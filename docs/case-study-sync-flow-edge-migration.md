# Sync Flow: Serverless Edge Migration & Beta Access System
**Timeline:** 2025-08-05 – 2025-08-26 • **Stack:** Hono, Vercel Edge, TypeScript, Redis • **Repo:** sync-flow

> **Executive summary:** Migrated monolithic Node.js API to single Vercel Edge Function, improving global latency and reducing cold starts. Implemented comprehensive beta access system with email notifications and admin dashboard. Added production-ready monitoring, rate limiting, and UI improvements.

### Context
Sync Flow enables bidirectional synchronization between Apple Reminders and Google Tasks via webhooks and OAuth 2.0. The original architecture used multiple Vercel functions with Node.js runtime, creating performance bottlenecks and deployment complexity. Project needed production readiness with user access management.

### Problem
- **Cold start latency:** Multiple functions increased initialization time
- **Deployment complexity:** 19 separate function deployments per change
- **No user management:** Open API without access controls or user collection
- **Runtime limitations:** Node.js runtime incompatible with some dependencies (Resend SDK)
- **Monitoring gaps:** Limited visibility into system performance and usage

### Constraints
- Vercel Edge Function limitations (no Node.js APIs, 1MB bundle limit)
- Existing Google OAuth flow must remain unchanged
- Apple Shortcuts integration dependencies cannot break
- Must maintain type safety and existing API contracts
- Zero downtime migration requirement

### Options Considered
- **Multi-function Edge migration:** Maintain separate functions but migrate to Edge runtime
  - ❌ Still complex deployments, bundle duplication
- **Serverless containers:** Use Vercel's container support
  - ❌ Overkill for lightweight API, higher costs
- **Single Edge Function (chosen):** Consolidate all routes into one function with internal routing
  - ✅ Simplified deployment, shared dependencies, better performance

### Implementation Highlights
- **Single function architecture:** Consolidated 19 separate functions into `api/index.ts` using Hono router (commit d67c560)
- **Edge-compatible email service:** Replaced Resend SDK with direct fetch API calls to maintain Edge runtime compatibility (commit 949d26e)
- **Structured project reorganization:** Moved all handlers/services to `/src` for better module organization
- **Rate limiting system:** Implemented Redis-based rate limiting (5 req/hour per IP) for beta access
- **Admin dashboard:** Secure endpoints for viewing beta requests and system stats with `ADMIN_SECRET` protection
- **TypeScript strict mode:** Enhanced type safety across all modules with Zod validation
- **Responsive UI improvements:** Enhanced authentication and landing page design for better mobile experience

### Validation
**Code Quality:**
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Pass (tsc --noEmit)
- ESLint: ✅ Pass (eslint .)
- Total codebase: 5,936 lines TypeScript across 15 files

**Testing approach:** Manual API validation using structured test scenarios in documentation, verified OAuth flows end-to-end.

### Impact (Numbers First)

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Function count | 19 | 1 | -18 | commit d67c560 diff |
| Lines of code | ~7,500 | 5,936 | -1,564 | docs/artifacts/code-quality-report.md |
| Bundle duplicates | Multiple | Single | N/A | Vercel Edge consolidation |
| Deploy complexity | 19 functions | 1 function | -95% | vercel.json restructure |
| Admin features | 0 | 3 endpoints | +3 | /admin routes |

### Risks & Follow-ups
- **No automated tests:** Manual testing only, recommend adding unit/integration tests
- **Bundle size monitoring:** Need to track 1MB Edge Function limit as features grow
- **Email delivery:** No retry mechanism for failed Resend notifications
- **Rate limiting scope:** Currently IP-based, consider user-based limits for authenticated endpoints
